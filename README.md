[Testing.md](https://github.com/skyeoh06/assign4-ecommence/blob/master/Testing.md)

## Deployment
### Running the project locally.
This project is build using Gitpod.
The steps I went through to run the project locally are as follows:

1. Install the gitpod extensions for the local machine browser.
2. Sign up for a github account and login.
3. Sign up for a gitpod account and link it to github account.
4. Go to the personal github pages and start a new repository using the 
[Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
5. The project folder will be available on the personal github page repository.
6. At the top right of the personal repository, there is a green coloured Gitpod button.
7. Click on the Gitpod link to open up the development environment for this project in Gitpod.
8. Once the project has fully loaded in the browser, a Visual Studio Code-like editor with a terminal will be seen.
9. In the Coding environment terminal, install the following requirements:  
    a. pip3 install django==2.2.14  
    b. pip3 install django-allauth  
    c. pip3 install django-crispy-forms
10. Set up the environment variables as follows:  
    a. Create a .env file  
    b. Create a .gitignore file to list the names of files to be omitted from git.  
    c. In the .env file, place the Django Secret Key, and the Stripe Publishable Key, Stripe Secret Key and Stripe Endpoint Secret.  
    d. The initial coding is done using SQLite. On deploy after obtaining the database url, the production database url is to be 
    inserted into the .env file too.
11. Generate the requirements.txt file with the following commands typed into the terminal:
```console
$ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
12. Setting up Django  
a. To start a project, the following command is keyed into the terminal:
```console
$ django-admin startapp `<project_name>` .
```
b. To start a new app under this project, the following command is keyed into the terminal:
```console
$ django-admin startapp `<app_name>`
```
c. To setup the database programmatically via Django:
```console
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```
d. To create migration files for the database:
```console
$ python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
e. To create superuser:
```console
$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

13. Data is populated manually via the admin interface or via the written codes, depending on the website design.  

14. Finally, the website pages are served by typing the below into the console:
```console
$ python3 manage.py runserver 8080
```

## Deployment on Heroku
1. Install the following dependencies via the terminal:
```console
$ pip3 install gunicorn
$ pip3 install psycopg2
$ pip3 install Pillow
$ pip3 install whitenoise
$ pip3 install dj_database_url
```

2. Add whitenoise to the middleware. White noise is for helping Django to serve static files in production.
```
MIDDLEWARE = [
.....
'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware'
]
```

3. Sign up for Heroku account
4. Login Heroku in the terminal

```console
$ heroku login -i

```

5. Type in the below to create a heroku app, where `<the_name_of_the_project>` is the name of the project to be deployed.  

```console
$ heroku create <name_of_the_project>

```

6. then create a remote repository by typing in 

```console
$ git remote -v
```

7. Create a Procfile with the content "web gunicorn `<name of the project>`.wsgi:application
8. Update the allowed host in settings.py to the newly created heroku app domain name.
9. Freeze all project dependencies by keying in to the terminal 

```console
$ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt 
```
10. Add STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

11. Finally push the project to git as below:

```console
$ git add.
$ git commit -m <deployment message>
$ git push heroku master
```

## Setting Up the Database for Production.
1. Add import dj_database_url to settings.py
2. Change the databases setting in settings.py to get the default database url from env variable as below:
```
DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])}
```
3. Run database migrate again to setup the database:
```console
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```
4. Setup superuser account and populate the database with data like the steps described in section "Running the project locally
12c-12e."

## Bugs and improvements
