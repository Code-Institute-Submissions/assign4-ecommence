                        It is a truth universally acknowledged that when most people think of Jane 
                        Austen they think of this charming and humorous story of love, difficult families 
                        and the tricky task of finding a handsome husband with a good fortune.</p>

                        In Little Women, Louisa May Alcott set out to write a book in which 
                        girls would see them themselves accurately reflected. The March sisters, 
                        with their four very different personalities and ambitions, accurately 
                        embody both the challenges of growing up and the irreplaceable bond of sisterhood.</p>
